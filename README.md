This project provides a quantitative means by which to compare Ariana Grande's albums, songs, and lyrics, and hopefully provide predictive power in regards to landing on the Billboard Hot 100 chart.

With Ariana's new music video Thank U Next breaking Vevo and YouTube's record for most music video views and views in general upon 24 hours of release, it seems clear that Ariana Grande has yet to reach her prime. However, there is incessant debate amongst her fans concerning which of her eras reigns supreme: the lovey-dovey Yours Truly era, the collaboration-heavy but more somber My Everything era, (and so on)? To address this question, as well as see what factors could distinguish songs that hit the Billboard charts from those that don't, I decided to conduct an Arianalysis, or, in other words, an analysis of her songs, lyrics, and albums. The analysis centers on song length, lexical diversity within songs and albums, and most frequently used / important words in each album.

The data utilized in the project was parsed from Genius.com (album tracklists and song lyrics) and Billboard.com (chart status and level).
I decided to only incorporate songs from Ariana's four studio albums (disregarded EPs, remixes, and miscellaneous, relatively unknown singles) and two of her most popular singles (Foucs and Thank U Next) because these songs are expected to be less popular than her official releases, and I did not want them to skew the results. This was the same reason that I did not include her short introductory ballads from My Everything and Sweetener.

In essence, with this project I hope to provide a method for taking a deeper dive into Ariana's life and career and see what fellow Arianators can glean from it.
